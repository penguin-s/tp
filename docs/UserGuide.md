## Introduction

MoneyGoWhere is a financial planning application to help you manage your finances.

Based on a Command Line Interface (CLI), you can add your `expenses`, `income` sources, spending `targets` and `recurring payments` to a trackable list that can be saved and accessed **anywhere, anytime**.

Although this application is mainly targeted at computing professionals who are familiar with CLI, **you don't have to worry if you're not an expert** -- MoneyGoWhere is **easy to pick up** and can help you start organising your finances in a matter of **moments**.


## Quick Start

1. Ensure that ```Java 11``` is installed on your system.
    1. Execute the command ```java --version``` in your terminal window.
    2. Verify that the version of Java installed is ```Java 11```.
2. Ensure that you have write permissions for the directory in which you are executing the program.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**:
As you enter data into MoneyGoWhere, it creates a **Memory** folder in the same directory as the *.jar* file.
You may use any of your preferred tool to transfer the **Memory/MoneyGoWhereData.xml** data file to another computer and run the [`Merge-File`](#merging-a-data-file-merge-file) command to merge the copied file.
